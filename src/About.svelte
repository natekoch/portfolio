            <p class="text-lg text-accent">
                I am currently a third-year computer and information science major with a minor in audio production at the University of Oregon. 
                While I am currently attending school and residing in Eugene, Oregon, I was born and raised in beautiful Portland, Oregon. 
                From a young age, I have always found myself drawn to figuring out how computers and various pieces of technology work. 
                I discovered my passion for computer programming in late middle school. 
                Beyond simply just computers, I have also found a love for music. 
                A love that I find myself an avid listener and creator. 
                I invest time into audio production and sound design through analog and digital methods. 
                I also love exploring nature with the Canon F-1 my late-grandfather gave to me years ago. 
                I have showcased some of my adventures on the photography page of this website. 
                If you have any further questions about me please don't hesitate to ask by contacting me through the "Contact Me" page on this website.
