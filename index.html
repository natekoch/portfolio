      <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
      <p>I am a recent computer science graduate with a minor in audio production from the University of Oregon. 
        While I am currently residing in Eugene, Oregon, I was born and raised in beautiful Portland, Oregon. 
        From a young age, I have always found myself drawn to figuring out how computers and various pieces of technology work. 
        I discovered my passion for computer programming in late middle school. 
        In addition to my passion for computers, I have found a love for music. I have become an avid listener and creator and enjoy adding to my vinyl collection. 
        I invest time into audio production and sound design through analog and digital methods. 
        I also love exploring nature with the Canon FTb my late-grandfather gave to me years ago. 
        I have showcased some of my adventures on the photography page of this website.

        <span><a href="https://github.com/natekoch/CPU-Rasterizer">CPU-Rasterizer</a> - C</span>
        <span>A CPU based computer graphics rasterizer with phong shading and camera rotation built from scratch.</span>
        <span>Capable of rasterizing millions of triangles.</span>
        <span>Final state of this program showcases modeling important medical models like an aneurysm.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><a href="https://github.com/natekoch/DuckChat">DuckChat</a> - C/C++</span>
        <span>A client-server UDP chat application with optional server to server communication.</span>
        <span>Designed to handle and connect hundreds of user simultaneously.</span>
        <span>With the optional server to server mode enabled, DuckChat could theoretically deploy servers across the globe to communicate with each other.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><a href="https://github.com/natekoch/tac">tac</a> - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Docker</span>
        <span>An online call-to-action event organization platform deployed as a progressive web application.</span>
        <span>Directed the design of the user interface as well as implemented it.</span>
        <span>tac was built as a decentralized platform that servered as an online bulitin board or a powerline post where people staple fliers.</span>
        <span>Worked alongside four other developers in a team called nope logistics.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><a href="https://github.com/natekoch/Route-Finder">Route Finder</a> - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Docker</span>
        <span>A multistop navigation PWA.</span>
        <span>Was in charge of designing the user interface and implemented it.</span>
        <span>Route Finder was created in order to provide an online solution for people with busy lives with lots of errands and small businesses with many deliveries to be completed in a single round trip.</span>
        <span>Our product was able to solve the traveling salesperson problem, or TSP, with an 86% optimal solution.</span>
        <span>An ant colony optimization algorithm was integrated in order to achieve such optimal results.</span>
        <span>Worked alongside four other developers in a team called nope logistics.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><a href="https://github.com/natekoch/NextUp">NextUp</a> - Swift, SwiftUI</span> 
        <span>An iOS app designed to help you stay on task by only showing you what is next up.</span>
        <span>Capable of taking a long to do list of hundereds of tasks and only showing you what the next thing you have to do is.</span>
        <span>Designed with human psychology in mind to not overwhelm and make a lot of things to do look small and more approachable.</span>

        <span><a href="https://github.com/natekoch/OpenGL-LevelOfDetail">OpenGL-LevelOfDetail</a> - C/C++</span>
        <span>A level of detail computer graphics performance demo.</span>
        <span>Created to test load on a GPU while simulateneously determining what level of detail was required to present a good looking image to the human eye.</span>
        <span>Drawn spheres were rasterized with varying levels of recursion while also the number of spheres rendered at varied recursion levels.</span>
        <span>Results were determined by framerate tests and visual inspection.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span><a href="https://github.com/natekoch/OpenGL-Dog">OpenGL-Dog</a> - C/C++</span>
